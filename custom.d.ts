// To use non-code assets with TypeScript, we need to defer the type for these imports.
// This requires a custom.d.ts file which signifies custom type definitions.
// Here we declare a new module for SVGs by specifying any import that ends in .svg
// and defining the module's content as any. We could be more explicit about it being
// a url by defining the type as string. The same concept applies to other assets
// including CSS, SCSS, JSON and more.
declare module '*.svg' {
  const content: any;
  export default content;
}

declare module '*';
